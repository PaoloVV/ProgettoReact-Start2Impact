# VegeBook - Vegetarian Recipes

This is my React/Vite project for the Start2Impact Front-end Developer master.

## Project

You can try the app here: [Project Link](https://paolovv.github.io/ProgettoReact-Start2Impact/)

## Description
This app allows you to search for vegetarian recipes using API calls to the spoonacular site ( [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com) )
There are 2 search pages available.
The first with advanced search filters (by name, by calories, by preparation time and vegan recipes);
the second returns 6 completely random recipes.

## Tecnologies
The technologies I used to create this app are:
* VITE JS  to create the app;
* REACT ROUTER DOM  for routing;
* REACT ICONS  to add original icons;
* REDUX TOOLKIT  to manage the state of the application (useSelector, useDispatch, reducers, slices...);
* REACT AXIOS   to handle API calls;
* TAILWIND CSS  for the style of the pages;
* GH-PAGES  for deployment on github pages.

## Clone Repository
If you want to clone and work on this project, remember to download the dependencies with the Node npm install command.
```node
  npm install
```

After this create an .env file in which to insert your VITE_API_KEY variable as shown in the .env.example file.
